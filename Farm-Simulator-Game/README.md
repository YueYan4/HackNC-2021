This game is designed to be submitted to HackNC 2021 (3 days to work on). 

Day 1:

Brainstormed what kind of functions are needed in our game.
I'm backend.

Built basic functions and interfaces Animal, Crop, Item, Store, Product.
Started work on the different classes that would implement these interfaces.

Day 2:

Finalized the animals, crops, items, and store stuff.
Started on farmer and farm classes. 

Unable to meet with the others in the group.

Day 3:

No one responded to Discord, so assume cannot submit in time.
I don't know anything about front-end development nor how to add the backend stuff to an interface.
